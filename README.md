## About RPSSL 🪨📄✂️🖖🦎

Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard ([RPSSL](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html)) is a popular five-weapon expansion of [Rock Paper Scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, which adds "Spock" and "lizard" to the standard three choices.

I started this project for fun when looking through challenges in [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Aside from the fun side, I also wanted to give [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) a try, so it was a good chance to start with something simple and fun 🙂

If you want to try this challenge too, [here's the link](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH). Have fun!
